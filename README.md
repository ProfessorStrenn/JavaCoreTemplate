# JavaCoreTemplate
Includes:
* `Program.java`, with a `main()` that is ready to go, and has useful classes statically imported.

* `sbcccore`:  Use `println()` instead of `System.out.println()`.  Lots of other functions that make Java life much nicer:  `readFile()`, `readFileAsLines()`, `writeFile()`, `readLine()`.  See [sbcccore](https://github.com/ProfessorStrenn/SbccCore) for details.

* `commons-lang3`:  With the wonderful `StringUtils`, which has `join`, `substringsBetween`, `reverse`, etc.

* [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) support, including a tailored set of rules (`cs106.ruleset`).
